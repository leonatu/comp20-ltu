# Finalizing Your Learning Portfolio

Comp 20 Lab 9  
December 4, 2018

## What is this purpose of this Git repository? 
To build a learning portfolio/to document effort, progress, achievements, and competencies gained in web programming

## What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
* Assignment 4
* It was fun to capitalize on my partner's security vulnerabilities in his web application! It was like a scavenger hunt to find these weaknesses and then we could apply what we learned in class to attack the app however we wanted. Accessing unauthorized data and sending unwanted data showed me how easy it was to conduct these attacks, which can have large scale and real-world consequences.

## How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
A lot! I came into this course not even knowing how the web works (bio major over here). I now have a basic understanding of how the web works, both on the client side and server side, as well as some knowledge of web security. I've learned how to effectively utilize resources (i.e. Google, Stack Overflow), ask for help when needed, and work better in teams. 

## What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
* Pay attention to details!
* This is important in every aspect of web programming, from writing code, to debugging, to web security. 
* But it's also applicable to everything in life--reading carefully is an important skill to have.
* Example 1: Assignment 3 (2048)--I knew I had a syntax error somewhere based on what "heroku logs" was telling me, and I spent hours trying to debug. Turns out, I was just missing "{}" within the db.collection.find() function (everything else was right)because the function takes in an *object,* not a string.
* Example 2: Assignment 4--Going through my partner's source code, it was crucial to carefully read rather than quickly skimming it in order to understand how the other person implemented his project. Careful reading allowed me to detect a security vulnerability immediately (hard-coded credentials), which could have been easily missed if careful attention to detail was not made.

## Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
Security! It's astonishing how many web applications are vulnerabile to privacy and security attacks, despite there being simple precautions to avoid them. They have serious implications in today's society where more and more people are using the internet on a daily basis. I'd like to learn about other security vulnerabilities, how attackers can exploit user data, and how to protect yourself from this.
